Ants Everywhere!

This is my very first project in my repository. This project is heavily inspired from Sebastian Lague's Ant and Slime simulation. This simulation is made to mimic the movement of ants. The game is small and simple. Ants move around the window and where ever the mouse points at, the ants will try to evade it as they travel around.

The game was made purely in Python. The module used to make it is called pygame, it's the backbone of the project. The program was coded in (OOP) style for easier implementation and modification of the project. I've made this project to help me with my logic working skills and help me improve my abilities. This project taught me a lot more about breaking down big problems into smaller and easier tasks for me to work with. It also taught me that you can solve one problem in many ways, but you only need the way that works best for your project.
